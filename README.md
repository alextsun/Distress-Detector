We recognize the fact that there are similar apps out there. However, once people are put in fight or flight situations, it is hard to pull out a phone, type in the password, and open up those other safety apps. The Distress Detector integrates the Microsoft band functionality with an android app to sense whether the user is distressed when they are in potentially dangerous situations. It monitors the users body signals (like heart rate) to see whether the user is in distress. If they are, the app will send a distress signal to the user's emergency contacts.
